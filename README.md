# Gesture_Recognition_Classifier

### Python built-in visualization
"I put together a script that combines pyglet, opencv and the CLIP model to draw a dot that tracks your movement and the color of the dot is controlled by whether you are smiling or are sad.
You will need to install pyglet and pyOpenGL as well as imgui[fiull]
Imgui allows you to draw an interactive UI easily and have buttons and sliders that you can use to experiment and customize your app.
For this example, you should ignore all the initialization code as well as all the code in the section marked “Ignore below this line”
For now focus on what happens in the drawing shapes section inside the draw_shapes() function.
There you have three parameters p.move_x, p.move_y and happiness that represent the centroid of movement XYs and the happiness of the video frame. You can map them to shapes and lines and colors in any way you like."
